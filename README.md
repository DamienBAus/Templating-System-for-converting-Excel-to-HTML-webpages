# Templating-System-for-converting-Excel-to-HTML-webpages
This system takes a set of projects (stored in an Excel Spreadsheet), converts them to a JSON file, which is then used by my website code to construct HTML for my project pages. 

The first step of this workflow is populating the Excel Spreadsheet (Projects_export.xlsm) with the project data, and hitting the 'Export Projects to .json' button.
This button uses a VBA macro to read the spreadsheet, and generate a .json file with all the project data, which sits in Website Files/js/projects.json

The JavaScript in projects.js and project_specific.js queries this .json file (using AJAX) and constructs HTML that is displayed on the specific page on the site. Project specific pages are generated by reading in the parameter passed in by the URL at the top of the page. 

The results of this workflow can be seen on the pages projects.html and project_specific.html?project_id=FOOBAR (where FOOBAR is the ID of the project being viewed). 

In order to update the website, you simply have to updated the json file, and upload it to it's relevant position. The generation should be done offline.
